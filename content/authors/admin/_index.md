I'm a climate scientist, interested in the intersection of climate modelling, extreme events, climate change impacts, adaptation and nature-based solutions and water resources.

In my research, I employ modelling techniques, like the COSMO-CLM and ALARO regional climate models. In the past I heavily used [Community Earth System Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/), its land model [Community Terrestrial Systems Model](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/land/), and the river-routing model mizuRoute as well as impact models from the [ISIMIP project](https://www.isimip.org/).  

In my postdoctoral position at the [Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern](https://www.wyssacademy.org/) and the [Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/), I study the potential hydrological co-benefits of nature-based approaches, which play a key role in climate mitigation and adaptation. My research focuses on investigating the hydrological impact of conservation and restoration projects, and whether such projects can be used to restore the water balance. 

I obtained my PhD at the [Department of Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering](https://www.hydr.vub.be/), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, funded by a personal PhD fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders ([FWO](https://www.fwo.be/en/)), in which I investigated the role of reservoirs in a changing climate.
