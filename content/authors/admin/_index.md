Welcome to my website! I am Inne Vanderkelen, a climate scientist excited about climate modelling, extreme events, climate change impacts, adaptation and nature-based solutions and water resources. Currently, I am working as a [Fed-tWIN](https://www.belspo.be/belspo/research/FEDtWIN_en.stm) researcher at the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at KU Leuven and the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (KMI). 

In my research, I employ climate models, like the COSMO-CLM and ALARO regional climate models to investigate potential climate adaptation options. In addition, I directly contribute to climate scenarios tailored for Belgium within the [CORDEX.be II project](https://cordex.meteo.be/), thereby contributing to improved risk assessments.

I obtained my PhD at the [Department of Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering](https://www.hydr.vub.be/), Vrije Universiteit Brussel, funded by a personal PhD fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders ([FWO](https://www.fwo.be/en/)), in which I investigated the role of reservoirs in a changing climate. 7

In my postdoctoral position at the [Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern](https://www.wyssacademy.org/) and the [Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research](https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/), I studied the potential hydrological co-benefits of nature-based approaches, which play a key role in climate mitigation and adaptation.
