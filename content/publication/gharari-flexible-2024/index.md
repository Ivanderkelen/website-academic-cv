abstract: Lakes and reservoirs are an integral part of the terrestrial water cycle.
  In this work, we present the implementation of different water balance models of
  lakes and reservoirs into mizuRoute, a vector-based routing model, termed mizuRoute-Lake.
  As the main advantage of mizuRoute-Lake, users can choose between various parametric
  models implemented in mizuRoute-Lake. So far, three parametric models of lake and
  reservoir water balance, namely Hanasaki, HYPE, and DÃ¶ll are implemented in mizuRoute-Lake.
  In general, the parametric models relate the outflow from lakes or reservoirs to
  the storage and various parameters including inflow, demand, volume of storage,
  etc. Additionally, this flexibility allows users to easily evaluate and compare
  the effect of various water balance models for a lake without needing to reconfigure
  the routing model or change the parameters of other lakes or reservoirs in the modeling
  domain. Users can also use existing data such as historical observations or water
  management models to specify the behavior of a selected number of lakes and reservoirs
  within the modeling domain using the data-driven capability of mizuRoute-Lake. We
  demonstrate the flexibility of mizuRoute-Lake by presenting global, regional, and
  local scale applications. The development of mizuRoute-Lake paves the way for better
  integration of water management models, locally measured, and remotely sensed data
  sets in the context of Earth system modeling.
