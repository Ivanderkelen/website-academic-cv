abstract: Reservoir expansion over the last century has largely affected downstream
  flow characteristics. Yet very little is known about the impacts of reservoir expansion
  on the climate. Here, we implement reservoir construction in the Community Land
  Model by enabling dynamical lake area changes, while conserving mass and energy.
  Transient global lake and reservoir extent are prescribed from the HydroLAKES and
  Global Reservoir and Dam databases. Land-only simulations covering the 20th century
  with reservoir expansion enabled, highlight increases in terrestrial water storage
  and decreases in albedo matching the increase in open water area. The comparison
  of coupled simulations including and excluding reservoirs shows only limited influence
  of reservoirs on global temperatures and the surface energy balance, but demonstrates
  substantial responses locally, in particular where reservoirs make up a large fraction
  of the grid cell. In those locations, reservoirs dampen the diurnal temperature
  range by up to âˆ’1.5 K (for reservoirs covering textgreater15% of the grid cell),
  reduce temperature extremes, and moderate the seasonal temperature cycle. This study
  provides a first step towards a coupled representation of reservoirs in Earth System
  Models.
