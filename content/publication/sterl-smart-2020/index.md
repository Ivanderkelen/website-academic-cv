abstract: The worldwide growth of variable renewable power sources necessitates power
  system flexibility to safeguard the reliability of electricity supply. Yet today,
  flexibility is mostly delivered by fossil fuel power plants. Hydropower can be a
  renewable alternative source of flexibility, but only if operated according to adequate
  strategies considering hourly-to-decadal and local-to-regional energy and water
  needs. Here, we present a new model to investigate hydro–solar–wind complementarities
  across these scales. We demonstrate that smart management of present and future
  hydropower plants in West Africa can support substantial grid integration of solar
  and wind power, limiting natural gas consumption while avoiding ecologically harmful
  hydropower overexploitation. We show that pooling regional resources and planning
  transmission grid expansion according to spatiotemporal hydro–solar–wind synergies
  are crucial for optimally exploiting West Africa’s renewable potential. By 2030,
  renewable electricity in such a regional power pool, with solar and wind contributing
  about 50%, could be at least 10% cheaper than electricity from natural gas.
