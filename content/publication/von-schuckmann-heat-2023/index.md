abstract: The Earth climate system is out of energy balance, and heat has accumulated
  continuously over the past decades, warming the ocean, the land, the cryosphere,
  and the atmosphere. According to the Sixth Assessment Report by Working Group I
  of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this planetary warming over multiple
  decades is human-driven and results in unprecedented and committed changes to the
  Earth system, with adverse impacts for ecosystems and human systems. The Earth heat
  inventory provides a measure of the Earth energy imbalance (EEI) and allows for
  quantifying how much heat has accumulated in the Earth system, as well as where
  the heat is stored. Here we show that the Earth system has continued to accumulate
  heat, with 381±61 ZJ accumulated from 1971 to 2020. This is equivalent to a heating
  rate (i.e., the EEI) of 0.48±0.1 W m−2. The majority, about 89 %, of this heat is
  stored in the ocean, followed by about 6 % on land, 1 % in the atmosphere, and about
  4 % available for melting the cryosphere. Over the most recent period (2006–2020),
  the EEI amounts to 0.76±0.2 W m−2. The Earth energy imbalance is the most fundamental
  global climate indicator that the scientific community and the public can use as
  the measure of how well the world is doing in the task of bringing anthropogenic
  climate change under control. Moreover, this indicator is highly complementary to
  other established ones like global mean surface temperature as it represents a robust
  measure of the rate of climate change and its future commitment. We call for an
  implementation of the Earth energy imbalance into the Paris Agreement's Global Stocktake
  based on best available science. The Earth heat inventory in this study, updated
  from von Schuckmann et al. (2020), is underpinned by worldwide multidisciplinary
  collaboration and demonstrates the critical importance of concerted international
  efforts for climate change monitoring and community-based recommendations and we
  also call for urgently needed actions for enabling continuity, archiving, rescuing,
  and calibrating efforts to assure improved and long-term monitoring capacity of
  the global climate observing system. The data for the Earth heat inventory are publicly
  available, and more details are provided in Table 4.
