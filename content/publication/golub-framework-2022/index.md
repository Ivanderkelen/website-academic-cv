  Empirical evidence demonstrates that lakes and reservoirs are warming across the
  globe. Consequently, there is an increased need to project future changes in lake
  thermal structure and resulting changes in lake biogeochemistry in order to plan
  for the likely impacts. Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on lakes
  have often relied on a single model forced with limited scenario-driven projections
  of future climate for a relatively small number of lakes. As a result, our understanding
  of the effects of climate change on lakes is fragmentary, based on scattered studies
  using different data sources and modelling protocols, and mainly focused on individual
  lakes or lake regions. This has precluded identification of the main impacts of
  climate change on lakes at global and regional scales and has likely contributed
  to the lack of lake water quality considerations in policy-relevant documents, such
  as the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
  Here, we describe a simulation protocol developed by the Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral
  Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) for simulating climate change impacts
  on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change scenarios for ISIMIP
  phases 2 and 3. The protocol prescribes lake simulations driven by climate forcing
  from gridded observations and different Earth system models under various representative
  greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCPs), all consistently bias-corrected on
  a 0.5textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm∘$textless/spantextgreater
  textlessspan class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater×textless/spantextgreater 0.5textlessspan
  class=\"inline-formula\"textgreater$^textrm∘$textless/spantextgreater global grid.
  In ISIMIP phase 2, 11 lake models were forced with these data to project the thermal
  structure of 62 well-studied lakes where data were available for calibration under
  historical conditions, and using uncalibrated models for 17 500 lakes defined for
  all global grid cells containing lakes. In ISIMIP phase 3, this approach was expanded
  to consider more lakes, more models, and more processes. The ISIMIP Lake Sector
  is the largest international effort to project future water temperature, thermal
  structure, and ice phenology of lakes at local and global scales and paves the way
  for future simulations of the impacts of climate change on water quality and biogeochemistry
