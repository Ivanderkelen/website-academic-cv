abstract: Lake ecosystems are jeopardized by the impacts of climate change on ice
  seasonality and water temperatures. Yet historical simulations have not been used
  to formally attribute changes in lake ice and temperature to anthropogenic drivers.
  In addition, future projections of these properties are limited to individual lakes
  or global simulations from single lake models. Here we uncover the human imprint
  on lakes worldwide using hindcasts and projections from five lake models. Reanalysed
  trends in lake temperature and ice cover in recent decades are extremely unlikely
  to be explained by pre-industrial climate variability alone. Ice-cover trends in
  reanalysis are consistent with lake model simulations under historical conditions,
  providing attribution of lake changes to anthropogenic climate change. Moreover,
  lake temperature, ice thickness and duration scale robustly with global mean air
  temperature across future climate scenarios (+0.9 °C °Cair–1, –0.033 m °Cair–1 and
  –9.7 d °Cair–1, respectively). These impacts would profoundly alter the functioning
  of lake ecosystems and the services they provide.
