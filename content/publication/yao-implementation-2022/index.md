abstract: Several previous studies have highlighted the irrigation-induced impacts
  on the global and regional water cycle, energy budget, and near-surface climate.
  While land models are widely used to address this question, the implementations
  of irrigation in these models vary in complexity. Here, we expand the representation
  of irrigation in Community Land Model to enable six different irrigation methods.
  We find that using a combination of irrigation methods, including default, sprinkler,
  flood and paddy techniques performs best as determined by evaluating the simulated
  irrigation water withdrawals against observations, and therefore select this combination
  as the new irrigation scheme. Then, the impact of the new irrigation scheme on surface
  fluxes is evaluated and detected using single-point simulations. Finally, the global
  and regional irrigation-induced impacts on surface energy and water fluxes are compared
  using both the original and the new irrigation scheme. The new irrigation scheme
  substantially reduces the bias and root-mean-square error of simulated irrigation
  water withdrawal in the USA and other countries, but considerably overestimates
  withdrawals in Central China. Results of single-point experiments show that different
  irrigation methods have different effects on surface fluxes, while the magnitudes
  are small. At the global scale, the new scheme enlarges the irrigation-induced impacts
  on water and energy variables relative to the original scheme, with varying magnitudes
  across regions. Overall, our results suggest that this newly developed scheme is
  a better tool for simulating irrigation-induced impacts on climate, and highlight
  the added value of incorporating human water management in Earth system models.
