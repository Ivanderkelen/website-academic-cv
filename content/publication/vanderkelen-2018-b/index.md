abstract: Lake Victoria, the second largest freshwater lake in the world, is one of
  the major sources of the Nile river. The outlet to the Nile is controlled by two
  hydropower dams of which the allowed discharge is dictated by the Agreed Curve,
  an equation relating outflow to lake level. Some regional climate models project
  a decrease in precipitation and an increase in evaporation over Lake Victoria, with
  potential important implications for its water balance and resulting level. Yet,
  little is known about the potential consequences of climate change for the water
  balance of Lake Victoria. In this second part of a two-paper series, we feed a new
  water balance model for Lake Victoria presented in the first part with climate simulations
  available through the COordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)
  Africa framework. Our results reveal that most regional climate models are not capable
  of giving a realistic representation of the water balance of Lake Victoria and therefore
  require bias correction. For two emission scenarios (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5), the decrease
  in precipitation over the lake and an increase in evaporation are compensated by
  an increase in basin precipitation leading to more inflow. The future lake level
  projections show that the dam management scenario and not the emission scenario
  is the main controlling factor of the future water level evolution. Moreover, inter-model
  uncertainties are larger than emission scenario uncertainties. The comparison of
  four idealized future management scenarios pursuing certain policy objectives (electricity
  generation, navigation reliability and environmental conservation) uncovers that
  the only sustainable management scenario is mimicking natural lake level fluctuations
  by regulating outflow according to the Agreed Curve. The associated outflow encompasses,
  however, ranges from 14m3 day-1 (-85 %) to 200m3 day-1 (C100 %) within this ensemble,
  highlighting that future hydropower generation and downstream water availability
  may strongly change in the next decades even if dam management adheres to he Agreed
  Curve. Our results overall underline that managing the dam according to the Agreed
  Curve is a key prerequisite for sustainable future lake levels, but that under this
  management scenario, climate change might potentially induce profound changes in
  lake level and outflow volume.
