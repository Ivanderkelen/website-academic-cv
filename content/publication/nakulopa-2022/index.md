abstract: The Rwenzori Mountains, in southwest Uganda, are prone to precipitation-related
  hazards such as flash floods and landslides. These natural hazards highly impact
  the lives and livelihoods of the people living in the region. However, our understanding
  of the precipitation patterns and their impact on related hazardous events and/or
  agricultural productivity is hampered by a dearth in in-situ precipitation observations.
  Here, we propose an evaluation of gridded precipitation products as potential candidates
  filling this hiatus. We evaluate three state-of-the-art gridded products, the ERA5
  reanalysis, IMERG satellite observations and a simulation from the convection-permitting
  climate model (CPM) COSMO-CLM, for their ability to represent precipitation totals,
  timing, and precipitation probability density function. The evaluation is performed
  against observations from 11 gauge stations that provide at least 2.5 years of hourly
  and half-hourly data, recorded between 2011 and 2016. Results indicate a poor performance
  of ERA5 with a persistent wet bias, mostly for stations in the rain-shadow of the
  mountain. IMERG gives the best representation of the precipitation totals as indicated
  by bias score comparisons. The CPM outperforms both ERA5 and IMERG in representing
  the probability density function, while both IMERG and the CPM have a good skill
  in capturing precipitation seasonal and diurnal cycles. The better performance of
  CPM is attributable to its higher resolution.This study highlights the potential
  of using IMERG and CPM precipitation estimates for hydrological and impact modeling
  over the Rwenzori mountains, preferring IMERG for precipitation totals and CPM for
  precipitation extremes.
