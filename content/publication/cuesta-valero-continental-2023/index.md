abstract: Heat storage within the Earth system is a fundamental metric for understanding
  climate change. The current energy imbalance at the top of the atmosphere causes
  changes in energy storage within the ocean, the atmosphere, the cryosphere, and
  the continental landmasses. After the ocean, heat storage in land is the second
  largest term of the Earth heat inventory, affecting physical processes relevant
  to society and ecosystems, such as the stability of the soil carbon pool. Here,
  we present an update of the continental heat storage, combining for the first time
  the heat in the land subsurface, inland water bodies, and permafrost thawing. The
  continental landmasses stored 23.8 ± 2.0 × 1021 J during the period 1960–2020, but
  the distribution of heat among the three components is not homogeneous. The sensible
  diffusion of heat through the ground accounts for ∼90 % of the continental heat
  storage, with inland water bodies and permafrost degradation (i.e. latent heat)
  accounting for ∼0.7 % and ∼9 % of the continental heat, respectively. Although the
  inland water bodies and permafrost soils store less heat than the solid ground,
  we argue that their associated climate phenomena justify their monitoring and inclusion
  in the Earth heat inventory.
