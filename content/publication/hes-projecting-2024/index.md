abstract: The forest understory experiences temperature variations that are dampened
  compared to adjacent open areas, allowing the development of a forest microclimate
  and associated ecological conditions. It is however unclear to what extent forests
  will maintain this buffering effect under increasing global warming. Providing reliable
  projections of future forest microclimates is therefore crucial to anticipate climate
  change impacts on forest biodiversity, and to identify corresponding conservation
  strategies. Recent empirical studies suggest that the buffering of air temperature
  extremes in forest understory compared to open land could increase with global warming,
  albeit at a slower rate than macroclimate temperatures. Here, we investigate the
  trend of this temperature buffering effect in a high-emission global warming scenario,
  using the process-based Land Surface Model CLM5.1. We find biome-dependant buffering
  trends with strongest values in tropical forests where buffering increases for every
  degree of global warming by 0.1 ∘C for maximum soil temperature, and by 0.2 ∘C for
  maximum canopy air temperature. In boreal regions, forest microclimate exhibits
  a strong seasonality and the effect of global warming is more uncertain. Thus, our
  results highlight the importance of tropical forest canopies in particular, in maintaining
  hospitable conditions for understory species while increasing their climate debt
  under global warming. Our research also illustrates the potential and limitations
  of Land Surface Models to simulate forest microclimate, and calls for further collaborations
  between Earth system modelers and ecologists to jointly question climate and biosphere
  dynamics.
