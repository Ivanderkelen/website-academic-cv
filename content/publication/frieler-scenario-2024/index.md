abstract: 'This paper describes the rationale and the protocol of the first component
  of the third simulation round of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison
  Project (ISIMIP3a, http://www.isimip.org, last access: 2 November 2023) and the
  associated set of climate-related and direct human forcing data (CRF and DHF, respectively).
  The observation-based climate-related forcings for the first time include high-resolution
  observational climate forcings derived by orographic downscaling, monthly to hourly
  coastal water levels, and wind fields associated with historical tropical cyclones.
  The DHFs include land use patterns, population densities, information about water
  and agricultural management, and fishing intensities. The ISIMIP3a impact model
  simulations driven by these observation-based climate-related and direct human forcings
  are designed to test to what degree the impact models can explain observed changes
  in natural and human systems. In a second set of ISIMIP3a experiments the participating
  impact models are forced by the same DHFs but a counterfactual set of atmospheric
  forcings and coastal water levels where observed trends have been removed. These
  experiments are designed to allow for the attribution of observed changes in natural,
  human, and managed systems to climate change, rising CH4 and CO2 concentrations,
  and sea level rise according to the definition of the Working Group II contribution
  to the IPCC AR6.'
