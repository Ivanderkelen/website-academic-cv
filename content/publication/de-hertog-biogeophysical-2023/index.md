abstract: 'Land cover and land management change (LCLMC) has been highlighted for
  its critical role in mitigation scenarios, both in terms of global mitigation and
  local adaptation. Yet, the climate effect of individual LCLMC options, their dependence
  on the background climate and the local vs. non-local responses are still poorly
  understood across different Earth system models (ESMs). Here we simulate the climatic
  effects of LCLMC using three state-of-the-art ESMs, including the Community Earth
  System Model (CESM), the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model
  (MPI-ESM) and the European Consortium Earth System Model (EC-EARTH). We assess the
  LCLMC effects using the following four idealized experiments: (i) a fully afforested
  world, (ii) a world fully covered by cropland, (ii) a fully afforested world with
  extensive wood harvesting and (iv) a full-cropland world with extensive irrigation.
  In these idealized sensitivity experiments, performed under present-day climate
  conditions, the effects of the different LCLMC strategies represent an upper bound
  for the potential of global mitigation and local adaptation. To disentangle the
  local and non-local effects from the LCLMC, a checkerboard-like LCLMC perturbation,
  i.e. alternating grid boxes with and without LCLMC, is applied. The local effects
  of deforestation on surface temperature are largely consistent across the ESMs and
  the observations, with a cooling in boreal latitudes and a warming in the tropics.
  However, the energy balance components driving the change in surface temperature
  show less consistency across the ESMs and the observations. Additionally, some biases
  exist in specific ESMs, such as a strong albedo response in CESM mid-latitudes and
  a soil-thawing-driven warming in boreal latitudes in EC-EARTH. The non-local effects
  on surface temperature are broadly consistent across ESMs for afforestation, though
  larger model uncertainty exists for cropland expansion. Irrigation clearly induces
  a cooling effect; however, the ESMs disagree whether these are mainly local or non-local
  effects. Wood harvesting is found to have no discernible biogeophysical effects
  on climate. Overall, our results underline the potential of ensemble simulations
  to inform decision making regarding future climate consequences of land-based mitigation
  and adaptation strategies.'
