abstract: 'Ecotron facilities allow accurate control of many environmental variables
  coupled with extensive monitoring of ecosystem processes. They therefore require
  multivariate perturbation of climate variables, close to what is observed in the
  field and projections for the future. Here, we present a new method for creating
  realistic climate forcing for manipulation experiments and apply it to the UHasselt
  Ecotron experiment. The new methodology uses data derived from the best available
  regional climate model projection and consists of generating climate forcing along
  a gradient representative of increasingly high global mean air temperature anomalies.
  We first identified the best-performing regional climate model simulation for the
  ecotron site from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment in the European
  domain (EURO-CORDEX) ensemble based on two criteria: (i) highest skill compared
  to observations from a nearby weather station and (ii) representativeness of the
  multi-model mean in future projections. The time window is subsequently selected
  from the model projection for each ecotron unit based on the global mean air temperature
  of the driving global climate model. The ecotron units are forced with 3-hourly
  output from the projections of the 5-year period in which the global mean air temperature
  crosses the predefined values. With the new approach, Ecotron facilities become
  able to assess ecosystem responses on changing climatic conditions, while accounting
  for the co-variation between climatic variables and their projection in variability,
  well representing possible compound events. The presented methodology can also be
  applied to other manipulation experiments, aiming at investigating ecosystem responses
  to realistic future climate change.'
