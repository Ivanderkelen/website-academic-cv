abstract: Heat uptake is a key variable for understanding the Earth system response
  to greenhouse gas forcing. Despite the importance of this heat budget, heat uptake
  by inland waters has so far not been quantified. Here we use a unique combination
  of global-scale lake models, global hydrological models and Earth system models
  to quantify global heat uptake by natural lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. The total
  net heat uptake by inland waters amounts to 2.6 ± 3.2 ×1020 J over the period 1900–2020,
  corresponding to 3.6% of the energy stored on land. The overall uptake is dominated
  by natural lakes (111.7%), followed by reservoir warming (2.3%). Rivers contribute
  negatively (-14%) due to a decreasing water volume. The thermal energy of water
  stored in artificial reservoirs exceeds inland water heat uptake by a factor ∼10.4.
  This first quantification underlines that the heat uptake by inland waters is relatively
  small, but non-negligible.
