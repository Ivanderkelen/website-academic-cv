abstract: textlessptextgreaterOne of the most important physical characteristics driving
  lifecycle events in lakes is stratification. Already subtle variations in the timing
  of stratification onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological
  effects, mainly by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and
  oxygen to organisms. Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global
  changes in stratification phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model
  ensemble and long-term observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification
  phenology across the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission
  scenario, stratification will begin 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 days
  later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3 ± 11.7 day prolongation
  in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on
  nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment
  of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is
  also likely.textless/ptextgreater
