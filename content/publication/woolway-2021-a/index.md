abstract: <p>One of the most important physical characteristics driving lifecycle
  events in lakes is stratification. Already subtle variations in the timing of stratification
  onset and break-up (phenology) are known to have major ecological effects, mainly
  by determining the availability of light, nutrients, carbon and oxygen to organisms.
  Despite its ecological importance, historic and future global changes in stratification
  phenology are unknown. Here, we used a lake-climate model ensemble and long-term
  observational data, to investigate changes in lake stratification phenology across
  the Northern Hemisphere from 1901 to 2099. Under the high-greenhouse-gas-emission
  scenario, stratification will begin 22.0 ± 7.0 days earlier and end 11.3 ± 4.7 days
  later by the end of this century. It is very likely that this 33.3 ± 11.7 day prolongation
  in stratification will accelerate lake deoxygenation with subsequent effects on
  nutrient mineralization and phosphorus release from lake sediments. Further misalignment
  of lifecycle events, with possible irreversible changes for lake ecosystems, is
  also likely.</p>
