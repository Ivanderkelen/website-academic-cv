If you passed by the *Beursplein* in the city center of Brussels on 26 June 2021, you should have noticed a group of very enthousiastic women scientists explaining their research on a soapbox. 
Together with 10 fantastic female scientists, I was privileged take part in the [Soapbox science event](http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2021-brussels/) organised by the local Brussels team working at the Space Pole Site in Uccle. 

The main aim of the [Soapbox Science initiative](http://soapboxscience.org/) is to bring science to the streets and thereby highlighting the women and non-binary scientists. Started in the UK a decade ago, there have been public events all over the world!

Get a taste of how it was in Brussels with the aftermovie (in Dutch):

And specifically on the story I was telling (in Dutch):
