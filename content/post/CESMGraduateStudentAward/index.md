I'm very, very honored to receive the CESM Graduate Student Award from the NCAR - The National Center for Atmospheric Research Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory, for my PhD work on implementing dams and reservoirs in the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

I implemented reservoirs as dynamic lakes in CTSM coupled to CESM and used this to assess the influence of historical reservoir expansion on the present-day climate: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JD034485

Second, I implemented dam operations in the river routing model mizuRoute, the new routing scheme of CESM: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/4163/2022/

With the ongoing coupling of mizuRoute to #CTSM, reservoir management will soon become a feature of CESM.


This would not have been possible without the great support of my supervisors Wim Thiery, Nicole van Lipzig and Ann van Griensven, as well as NCAR scientists Dave Lawrence, Bill Sacks, Erik Kluzek, Naoki Mizukami and collaborators Shervan Gharari, Martyn Clark, Yadu Pokhrel and Naota Hanasaki.
